# ELIDE — Phase Gate Tracker
**State (2026-11-10, 21:47 UTC):** P0 **partial**. Local bootstrap is done and verified. PayPal Sandbox OAuth, Invoicing v2 access, draft creation with the $10 discount and independent retrieval are **Sandbox-verified**. Sending the invoice and the payer payment are **not yet done** (they wait for owner approval). No financial features are implemented. Maintain this tracker in Git; update with commit, tests, redacted evidence and blocker notes.

| Phase | Gate | Status | Evidence to attach |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | API access + hosted Sandbox invoice payment route proven | **Partial**: bootstrap done; OAuth, Invoicing access, draft + GET Sandbox-verified; send + payer payment pending owner approval; CI not run | Redacted API responses + provider IDs/status + code SHA |
| P1 | Money model, reserves, fees, revisions and fixtures pass | Not started | pytest / property test output |
| P2 | Exact optimizer agrees with separate verifier and fair baselines | Not started | B0–B5 test table + seed/trace |
| P3 | Live policy parsing and bounded offer proposal safely gated | Not started | Prompt version + schema result + injection tests |
| P4 | Separate merchant sessions, approvals, permissioned UI | Not started | E2E run and auth isolation test |
| P5 | Actual PayPal payer payment + provider GET + safe replay | Not started | Redacted receipt + journal + webhook replay |
| P6 | QA, financial invariants, security and clean clone | Not started | CI, test matrix, known issues |
| P7 | Public license/repo, working demo, video, submission | Not started | Public links, release SHA, submission receipt |

## P0 detail (updated 2026-11-10)

### Implemented (evidence class: tested locally; no Sandbox evidence yet)
- Repository with the documented layout, `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` (identical rules,
  enforced by a test), README, MIT LICENSE, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.env.example`, ADRs 0001–0006.
- Authoritative docs copied into `docs/project-sources/`. All 18 match `ELIDE_SOURCES_SHA256.json`.
  The execution plan copy is byte-identical to the original.
- Backend: FastAPI app with `GET /health` (liveness) and `GET /health/ready` (DB check +
  config flags, no secrets). Pydantic settings use `SecretStr`, and placeholders count as
  unset. SQLAlchemy engine. Alembic baseline `0001_baseline` applied to PostgreSQL 16.15.
- Domain boundary packages (`domain`, `liquidity`, `planning`, `accounting`, `workers`)
  are **empty stubs** with documented responsibilities. No business logic yet.
- AI: provider-neutral `LLMAdapter` (structured output only, no tools). `UnconfiguredLLMAdapter`
  refuses instead of fabricating. A test checks that `api/ai` does not reference PayPal or integrations.
- PayPal adapter (`api/integrations/paypal/`): Sandbox-only client (OAuth, list/number/create/send/get
  invoice), exact cents ↔ decimal-string conversion, redaction. `scripts/paypal_sandbox_check.py`
  runs opt-in steps and writes redacted evidence. Run against Sandbox 2026-11-10 (see below).
- Frontend: React 19 + TS 6.0 + Vite 8 + Tailwind 4 + `@xyflow/react` (installed, not used yet).
  Status page reads `/api/health/ready` through the Vite proxy and labels the build as a Phase 0 scaffold.
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (backend + Postgres service, frontend). **Not executed**
  because no GitHub remote exists.

### PayPal Sandbox status (runs 2026-11-10, Sandbox only, environment `api-m.sandbox.paypal.com`)
Owner configured a dedicated Sandbox Merchant app with Invoicing enabled. Env check
(values not printed): `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`PAYPAL_SANDBOX_PAYER_EMAIL` present, no whitespace/quote issues, email-shaped.

| Step | HTTP | Debug id | Result | Evidence class |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. OAuth token (`POST /v1/oauth2/token`) | 200 | `f62629410eab7` | Bearer token, `expires_in` 32400; scope includes `https://uri.paypal.com/services/invoicing`. Token not stored | **Sandbox-verified** |
| 2. Invoicing access (`GET /v2/invoicing/invoices`) | 200 | `f626294a2fc40` | Merchant-owned access works; `total_items=0` before the test | **Sandbox-verified** |
| 2a. `POST /v2/invoicing/generate-next-invoice-number` | **415** → 200 | `f81253945e66d` (415) | First call: `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE` "The request payload is not supported" (our request lacked `Content-Type: application/json`). Fixed in `client.py`; re-run returned 200, `0002`. Non-blocking: PayPal auto-numbered the draft `0001` | **Sandbox-verified** |
| 3. Create draft (`POST /v2/invoicing/invoices`, `PayPal-Request-Id`, `Prefer: return=representation`) | 201 | `f4434203103cb` | **Exactly one** draft: `INV2-4RUV-XPEH-4F3C-T8BW`, status `DRAFT`, number `0001` | **Sandbox-verified** |
| 5. Independent GET (same run) | 200 | `f705628b8d281` | Amounts correct (see below). Run flagged `MISMATCH` only because our parser rejected PayPal's negative discount sign; parser corrected | **Sandbox-verified** |
| 5. Independent GET (separate process, corrected parser) | 200 | see run file | `status=DRAFT`, all requested terms match | **Sandbox-verified** |
| 4. Send → hosted `payer-view` link | — | — | **Not run, by design.** Requires owner approval | Specified |
| Actual payer payment | — | — | Not attempted. Requires owner approval + owner action in hosted page | Specified |
| Orders v2 fallback | — | — | Not needed so far: Invoicing access works | Specified |

**Provider-recorded terms of `INV2-4RUV-XPEH-4F3C-T8BW`** (from GET, in cents):

| Field | Requested | PayPal recorded | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| Currency | USD | USD | yes |
| Line item | 1 × 100000 | 1 × 100000 (`"1000.00"`) | yes |
| `item_total` | 100000 | 100000 | yes |
| `invoice_discount.amount` | 1000 (sent `"10.00"`) | 1000, returned as **`"-10.00"`** (negative sign) | yes (sign convention recorded) |
| `tax_total` | 0 | 0 | yes |
| Total (`amount.value`) | 99000 | 99000 (`"990.00"`) | yes |
| `due_amount` | 99000 | 99000 | yes |
| Status | DRAFT | DRAFT | yes |
| Payment term | not sent | `NO_DUE_DATE` (PayPal default) | n/a; recorded |
| Recipient | Sandbox personal payer | set (fingerprinted in evidence) | yes |

Redacted evidence (`evidence/paypal-sandbox/runs/`, scanned: no client id, secret,
payer email, `@` or access token present):
- `20261110T214449Z.json`: steps 1–2
- `20261110T214515Z.json`: steps 1–3, 2a (415), 5
- `20261110T214717Z.json`: separate-process GET, all terms match
- `20261110T214721Z.json`: numbering re-check, 200

Code changes made from these observations (ADR-0005 "Sandbox observations"): new
`api/integrations/paypal/invoice_terms.py` (exact parse of provider terms; negative sign
tolerated on the invoice discount field only); `generate_invoice_number` sends a JSON
content type; script compares every term, adds `--expected-status` and `--check-number`.

### Missing dependencies / environment notes
- GitHub CLI not installed (only needed for remote creation; system install needs approval).
- `python` on PATH is the Microsoft Store alias stub. Use `uv run` (no action needed).
- Port 5432 is held by a WSL PostgreSQL relay, so Elide uses 5433 (ADR-0003).
- LLM provider/model/key not chosen (open question 9, Phase 3).

### Owner actions required
1. ~~Create Sandbox accounts + app, fill `.env`~~ (done by owner 2026-11-10).
2. Approve sending the existing draft `INV2-4RUV-XPEH-4F3C-T8BW` to the Sandbox personal payer.
3. After the hosted payer link is produced, pay it as the Sandbox Personal account.
4. Later: approve GitHub repository name/visibility before any remote is created.

### Remaining P0 gate requirements
- [x] OAuth token obtained server-side (redacted evidence)
- [x] Invoicing v2 accessible for the owned Sandbox merchant
- [x] Draft invoice created; provider-computed total observed (discount behavior recorded: returned negative, total 99000)
- [ ] Invoice sent; hosted payer link observed (needs owner approval)
- [ ] Sandbox payer completes payment; provider GET confirms amount/currency/status
- [x] Redacted evidence + commit SHA recorded here (for steps 1–3, 5)
- [x] (if any step returns 403/unsupported) blocker recorded: no 403; one 415 on numbering, cause found and fixed. Orders v2 fallback not needed so far
- [ ] CI run green on GitHub (after the remote exists)

Note: the script's `--create-draft --send` mode would create a **second** draft. To
send the existing one, add a send-by-id option first (next task).

## Release claim categories
- **Specified**: exists in architecture/docs only.
- **Synthetic-tested**: program ran on invented data; not proof of merchant results.
- **Sandbox-verified**: independently fetched PayPal resource from actual sandbox operation.
- **Pilot-validated**: real consenting merchant evidence with appropriate comparison (outside current scope).

## Critical blockers to monitor
- PayPal Invoicing account scope, hosted payer completion and discount updates.
- Sufficient time for independent tests and public proof.
- Safe data and merchant authorizations; no cross-tenant disclosure.
- Stable access for judges through December 15 (free Render database expiration issue).

## Session log
- 2026-11-10 (Claude Code, Opus 5.5): P0 bootstrap. Scaffolded repo, backend, frontend,
  DB, PayPal adapter + check script, and agent instructions. All local checks green
  (see table). Bootstrap commit: `16c7276` ("P0: bootstrap repository", local only,
  not pushed). Stopped at the P0 gate, blocked on owner PayPal Sandbox credentials.
  **Next task:** once `.env` has Sandbox credentials, run `scripts/paypal_sandbox_check.py`
  steps 1→5, record results here, then have the owner pay the hosted invoice.
- 2026-11-10 (Claude Code, Opus 5.5): PayPal Sandbox steps 1–3 and 5 run against the
  owner's Sandbox Merchant app. OAuth 200, Invoicing list 200, one draft created (201,
  `INV2-4RUV-XPEH-4F3C-T8BW`), independent GET 200 with all terms matching (total 99000
  cents). Found and fixed: discount returned with negative sign (parser), 415 on
  generate-next-invoice-number (missing JSON content type). Tests: ruff clean, pytest
  52 passed. Stopped before send/payment as instructed. Commit: see `git log` ("P0:
  Sandbox-verify OAuth, Invoicing access and draft invoice").
  **Next task:** with owner approval, add a send-by-id option and send
  `INV2-4RUV-XPEH-4F3C-T8BW`; owner pays in the hosted page; verify with
  `--invoice-id INV2-4RUV-XPEH-4F3C-T8BW --expected-cents 99000 --expected-status PAID`.
